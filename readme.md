### Note: You can find more polished (ui and controls) version over [here](https://github.com/shivanju/pyxel-games/tree/master/Tetris)  
A minimal tetris clone made in [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)

1. Run app.py to start the game.
2. Use Z to rotate left, X to rotate right and Up to fast forward.
3. Use Left, Right and Down to move around.
4. Q to quit and R to restart.

Improvements are welcome.
